# Yammer Publisher A/B Test Analysis (Simulated Data)

This project is a simulation of an A/B test for Yammer's publisher feature. The analysis explores hypothetical data and aims to demonstrate the process of evaluating an experiment's results, even without access to real data.

## Objective
- Test whether the new publisher increases user engagement (e.g., message posting, login frequency).
- Apply statistical methods (e.g., t-tests) to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment.

## Notes
- Data used in this project is simulated and based on the example provided by the Yammer A/B test scenario.
